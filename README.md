##   📝 Description

</br>

The purpose of this repository is to apply the concepts reviewed during the week and modify starter code to generate an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The application will be deployed in Heroku.
